**Project**
The primary objective of this project is to analyze and understand the factors influencing airline customer satisfaction, enabling the identification of key drivers of passenger contentment and dissatisfaction. Customer satisfaction is critical in the airline industry as it directly impacts customer loyalty, brand reputation, and overall profitability. Satisfied passengers are more likely to choose the same airline for future travel, recommend it to others, and contribute to a competitive edge in a highly dynamic market.

This project utilizes tools like Tableau and Excel to analyze passenger feedback, demographic data, and service ratings. The goal is to provide actionable insights that will guide the airline in enhancing customer experiences, improving service quality, and tailoring offerings to meet the diverse needs of passengers across various demographics and flight types. This, in turn, will strengthen customer retention and drive business growth.
